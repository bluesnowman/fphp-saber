### Requirements

* PHP 7.0+
* The [mbstring](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) extension or the [iconv](http://php.net/manual/en/book.iconv.php) extension (only if dealing with different character sets).
* The [gmp](http://php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php) extension (only if using `IInteger\Type`).

### [Boxing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yz2be5wk.aspx)

To "box" a PHP typed primitive or object, create an instance of the respective data type using the  class's `make` method.  This method enforces the type by converting the value to the correct data type.  If the value cannot be converted to the correct data type, an exception will be thrown.

````
$object = IInt32\Type::make(7);
````

For better performance, use the `box` method to avoid any unnecessary pre-processing that its corresponding `make` method might otherwise perform before creating the instance.

````
$object = IInt32\Type::box(7);
````

Some data types are initialized using a singleton method.  For instance, the `IUnit\Type` class is initialized like so:

````
$object = IUnit\Type::instance();
````

Similarly, other data types have more specific singleton methods.  Amongst these is the `ITrit` data type, which has three singleton methods for negative one, zero, and positive one.

````
$negative = ITrit\Type::negative();
$zero = ITrit\Type::zero();
$positive = ITrit\Type::positive();
````

It is recommend that you use these factory/singleton methods, when possible, instead of using the constructor to initialize a data type.  This is for both conventional reasons and implementation reasons.

To "unbox" a boxed object, call the `unbox` method on the respective class to get its value.

````
$value = $object->unbox();
````

### [Fluent API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)

Many data types allow for a fluent API; therefore, many methods can be chained together in one statement.  Through the use of PHP's magical `__call` method, certain data types can access their respective module's methods as if they were instance methods.  (Methods in a module are defined similarly to how [extension methods](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx) are defined in C#.)  For example, you can do the following:

````
$object = IInt32\Type::box(7)->increment()->decrement();
````

This statement is functionally equivalent to writing:

````
$object = IInt32\Module::decrement(IInt32\Module::increment(IInt32\Type::box(7)));
````

Note: this fluent API only works with methods that return `Core\Type` objects.

### Classes

A `Type` class defines a lean interface for a particular type.

A `Module` class defines a set of methods that are used to process its corresponding `Type` class.  All methods are static and must define for their first argument its corresponding `Type` class.

A `Utilities` class defines an assortment of methods that are related to its corresponding `Type` class.  All methods are static.

An `Iterator` class defines how a collection is counted and iterated over by PHP.

### Methods

In general, methods that are NOT preceded by two underscores will return a boxed object.

````
$object = IInt32\Type::box(7)->increment();
````

One notable exception to this rule is the `unbox` method.

Methods that are preceded by two underscores will return an unboxed value, which is typically a PHP typed primitive or object.  This is made possible via PHP's magical `__call` method.

````
$value = IInt32\Type::box(7)->__increment();
````

This is essentially functionally equivalent to writing:

````
$value = IInt32\Type::box(7)->increment()->unbox();
````

### Variables

This library has adopted the following naming conventions for certain variables:

`$c` usually represents a carried value.<br />
`$e` usually represents an exception.<br />
`$i`, `$j`, and `$k` usually represent an index or count.<br />
`$n` usually represents a quantity.<br />
`$p` usually represents a position.<br />
`$r` usually represents a result.<br />

`$x`, `$y`, and `$z` usually represent an object or a value.<br />
`$xs`, `$ys`, and `$zs` usually represent a collection of `$x`, `$y`, and `$z` objects/values, respectively.<br />
`$xss`, `$yss`, and `$zss` usually represent a collection of `$xs`, `$ys`, and `$zs` collections, respectively.<br />

`$xi`, `$yi`, and `$zi` usually represent an iterator for a collection of `$x`, `$y`, and `$z` objects/values, respectively.<br />
`$xsi`, `$ysi`, and `$zsi` usually represent an iterator for a collection of `$xs`, `$ys`, and `$zs` collections, respectively.<br />

### Callables

A `$closure` function does not have a predefined signature or return type; but, as a general rule, it should utilize Core\Type objects for parameter and return types.

````
function(?Core\Type... $m): ?Core\Type
````

An `$operator` function is used to find the result of applying an operator to one or more operands.

````
function(Core\Type $c): Core\Type
function(Core\Type $c, Core\Type $x): Core\Type
````

A `$predicate` function is used to find the result of performing a Boolean evaluation.

````
function(Core\Type $x): IBool\Type
function(Core\Type $x, IInt32\Type $i): IBool\Type
````

A `$procedure` function is used to perform an operation that does NOT return a value (even though, technically, PHP does return a `null` value by default).  In cases where logic benefits to use a return statement to terminate a procedure prematurely, the return value must be either a `null` value or an `IUnit\Type` object.

````
function(Core\Type $x): ?IUnit\Type
function(Core\Type $x, IInt32\Type $i): ?IUnit\Type
````

A `$subroutine` function is used to perform an operation that does return a value.

````
function(Core\Type $x): Core\Type
function(Core\Type $x, IInt32\Type $i): Core\Type
````

A `$tryblock` function is used to process a block of code that may throw a runtime exception.

````
function(): Core\Type
````

### Choices

Objects can be evaluated against each other using the `when` clause.  A `when` clause is satisfied when both `x` and `y` match (i.e. when `$x->__eq($y)` evaluates to `true`).  If a match is encountered, the clause will cause the `$procedure` to be executed.

````
$x = IInt32\Type::box(8);
$y = IInt32\Type::box(8);

Control\Type::choice($x)
	->when($y, function(IInt32\Type $x) {
		// passes, do something
	})
	->otherwise(function(IInt32\Type $x) {
		// skipped
	})
->end();
````

Objects can also be evaluated against each other using the `unless` clause.  An `unless`  clause is satisfied when both `x` and `y` do NOT match (i.e. when `$x->__eq($y)` evaluates to `false`).  If the result of the match is false, the clause will cause the `$procedure` to be executed.

````
$x = IInt32\Type::box(8);
$y = IInt32\Type::box(7);

Control\Type::choice($x)
	->unless($y, function(IInt32\Type $x) {
		// passes, do something
	})
	->otherwise(function(IInt32\Type $x) {
		// skipped
	})
->end();
````

### Sequences

A list containing a sequence of numbers can be easily created by doing the following:
````
$object = IInt32\Module::sequence(IInt32\Type::zero(), IInt32\Type::box(5));
````
This means [0..5].  It will produce [0,1,2,3,4,5].

You can also generate sequences like [0,2..10], which will produce [0,2,4,6,8,10].
````
$object = IInt32\Module::sequence(IInt32\Type::zero(), ITuple\Type::box2(IInt32\Type::box(2), IInt32\Type::box(10)));
````

Similar methods exist as well for IDouble, IFloat, and IInteger.

### Exceptions

To throw an exception, do the following:

````
$message = 'Hi, my name is :name';
$tokens = array(':name' => 'Blue Snowman');
$code = IInt32\Type::zero();
Control\Exception\Module::raise(new Throwable\UnexpectedValue\Exception(
    $message, // optional
    $tokens,  // optional
    $code     // optional
));
````

Besides using the traditional `try/catch` statement, you can use the built in `try_` control feature:

````
$either = Control\Exception\Module::try_(function() {
	// do something that might cause an exception to be thrown
});
````

This will wrap the result into an `IEither\Type`.  Convention dictates that the exception will be wrapped in an `IEither\Left\Type` and a successful result will be wrapped in an `IEither\Right\Type`.

### Hierarchy

Below describes the relationships between data types:

````
+ Core\Type
  + Control\Type
    + Choice\Type
  + Data\Type
    + IBool\Type
    + IChar\Type
    + ICollection\Type
      + IEither\Type
        + Left\Type
        + Right\Type
      + IMap\Type
        + IHashMap\Type

        + Some\Type
        + None\Type
      + ISet\Type
        + IHashSet\Type
      + ITuple\Type
      + IVector\Type
        + IArrayList\Type
        + ILinkedList\Type
        + IString\Type
    + INumber\Type
      + IFloating\Type : IFractional\Type
        + IDouble\Type : IReal\Type
        + IFloat\Type : IReal\Type
      + IIntegral\Type : IReal\Type
        + IInt32\Type
        + IInteger\Type
        + ITrit\Type
      + IRatio\Type : IFractional\Type
    + IObject\Type
    + IRegex\Type
    + IUnit\Type
  + Throwable\Runtime\Exception
    + Throwable\EmptyCollection\Exception
    + Throwable\InvalidArgument\Exception
    + Throwable\OutOfBounds\Exception
    + Throwable\Parse\Exception
    + Throwable\UnexpectedValue\Exception
    + Throwable\UnimplementedMethod\Exception
    + Throwable\Unknown\Exception
````

Most data types have a module associated with it.

ICollection types also have an iterator class so that the class can be used with PHP's `foreach` loop.  Because these iterator classes must conform to PHP's `Iterator` and `Countable` interfaces, methods in these classes do not necessarily conform to all of the conventions that this library otherwise uses (i.e. some non-doubly underscored methods will return PHP typed primitives instead their respective `Core\Type` objects).

### Unit Tests

This library provides a convenient `Makefile` for installing, updating, and uninstalling [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/).  Similarly, this `Makefile` can also be used to run any unit test included in this library.

To run this `Makefile`, navigate to the folder where it is located on your hard-drive and then type any of the following commands:

To install both Composer and PHPUnit:

````
make install
````

To update both Composer and PHPUnit:

````
make update
````

To uninstall both Composer and PHPUnit:

````
make uninstall
````

To run all unit tests:

````
make execute
````

To run just a specific group of unit tests, for example:

````
make execute GROUP=TypeTest
````

For more information regarding additional commands, see the [documentation](https://github.com/bluesnowman/fphp-saber/blob/master/Makefile) in the `Makefile` itself.
