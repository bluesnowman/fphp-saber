Saber
==========

A functional php library.

### Requirements

* PHP 5.4+
* The [mbstring](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) extension.
* The [gmp](http://php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php) extension (only if using `Data\Integer`).

### [Boxing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yz2be5wk.aspx)

To "box" a PHP typed primitive or object, create an instance of the respective data type using the
class's `box` method.  This method enforces type safety.

````
$object = Data\Int32::box(23);
````

For better performance, type safety can be ignored by using the `create` method to create an instance
of the respective data type.

````
$object = Data\Int32::create(23);
````

To "unbox" a boxed object, call the `unbox` method on the respective class to get its value.

````
$value = $object->unbox();
````

### [Fluent API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)

This library generally implements a fluent API; therefore, methods can be chained.

````
$object = Data\Int32::box(23)->increment()->decrement();
````

### Methods

In general, methods that are NOT preceded by two underscores will return a boxed object.  An
exception to this rule is the `unbox` method.

````
$object = Data\Int32::box(23)->increment();
````

Methods that are preceded by two underscores will return the unboxed value, which is typically
a PHP typed primitive or object.  This is made possible via PHP's magical `__call` method.

````
$value = Data\Int32::box(23)->__increment();
````

### Callables

An `operator` function is used to find the result of applying an operation to one or two operands.

````
Core\Any function(Core\Any $z)
Core\Any function(Core\Any $z, Core\Any $x)
````

A `predicate` function is used to find the result of performing a Boolean evaluation.

````
Data\Bool function(Core\Any $x)
Data\Bool function(Core\Any $x, Data\Int32 $i)
````

A `procedure` function is used to perform an operation without returning a value.

````
Data\Unit function(Core\Any $x)
Data\Unit function(Core\Any $x, Data\Int32 $i)
````

A `subroutine` function is used to perform an operation that does return a value.

````
Core\Any function(Core\Any $x)
Core\Any function(Core\Any $x, Data\Int32 $i)
````

### Choices

Objects can be evaluated against each other using the `when` clause.  A `when` clause is
satisfied when both `x` and `y` match (i.e. when `$x->equals($y)` evaluates to `true`).

````
$x = Data\Int32::box(8);
$y = Data\Int32::box(8);

Control\Monad::choice($x)
	->when($y, function(Data\Int32 $x) {
		// passes, do something
	})
	->otherwise(function(Data\Int32 $x) {
		// skipped
	})
->end();
````

Objects can also be evaluated against each other using the `unless` clause.  An `unless`
clause is satisfied when both `x` and `y` do NOT match (i.e. when `$x->equals($y)` evaluates
to `false`).

````
$x = Data\Int32::box(8);
$y = Data\Int32::box(7);

Control\Monad::choice($x)
	->unless($y, function(Data\Int32 $x) {
		// passes, do something
	})
	->otherwise(function(Data\Int32 $x) {
		// skipped
	})
->end();
````

### Unit Tests

This library provides a convenient `Makefile` for installing, updating, and uninstalling
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/).  Similarly, this
`Makefile` can also be used to run any unit test included in this library.

To run this `Makefile`, navigate to the folder where it is located on your hard-drive and
then type any of the following commands:

To install both Composer and PHPUnit:

````
make install
````

To update both Composer and PHPUnit:

````
make update
````

To uninstall both Composer and PHPUnit:

````
make uninstall
````

To run all unit tests:

````
make execute
````

To run just a specific group of unit tests, for example:

````
make execute GROUP=AnyVal
````

For more information, see the [documentation](https://github.com/bluesnowman/fphp-saber/blob/master/Makefile)
in the `Makefile` itself.
